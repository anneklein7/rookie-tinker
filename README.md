Beginner project vault!
Here's where I will be dumping my beginner projects as I work on freeCodeCamp's certification curriculum. 
Hopefully when I'm better at coding I can upload actual cool ideas! 
If you see me uploading CSS templates for Archive of Our Own fanfic... no you didn't xx
You can find me on Twitter @kleinlikeblue or on Dev.To (same user)!
